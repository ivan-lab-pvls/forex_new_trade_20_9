      title: "Cryptocurrency, Explained: A Guide for Beginners",
      description:
          "Cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a digital currency used as an alternative payment method or as an investment. Cryptocurrencies get their name from the cryptographic techniques that enable people to buy, sell or trade them securely without the need for a controlling authority, such as a government or financial institutions.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin was developed primarily to be a form of payment that isn't controlled or distributed by a central bank. People invest in cryptocurrencies for the same reason anyone invests in anything. They hope its value will rise, netting them a profit.\nIf people began using Bitcoin for payments on a huge scale, demand for Bitcoin would go up, and in turn, its price in dollars would increase. So, if you'd purchased one Bitcoin before that increase in demand, you could theoretically sell that one Bitcoin for more U.S. dollars than you bought it for, making a profit. \nHow does cryptocurrency work?\nCryptocurrencies are supported by a technology known as blockchain, which maintains a tamper-resistant record of transactions and keeps track of who owns what. The use of blockchains addressed a problem faced by previous efforts to create purely digital currencies: preventing people from making copies of their holdings and attempting to spend it twice\nIndividual units of cryptocurrencies can be referred to as coins or tokens, depending on how they are used. Some are intended to be units of exchange for goods and services, others are stores of value, and some can be used to participate in specific software programs such as games and financial products.",

      description: "BENGALURU, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is done hiking interest rates and will stay on hold until at least July next year, according to economists in a Reuters poll, who said there was only a one-in-five chance the central bank hikes again this year.\n\nLast week, the ECB raised its key interest rates for a 10th consecutive time, taking the deposit rate to a record high of 4.00% from a historic low of minus 0.50% in just over a year.\n\nThat decision came just days after Reuters reported the central bank would upgrade its 2024 inflation forecast, flipping expectations in favour of a hike from no move. \n\nAlthough the ECB upgraded its 2024 inflation outlook to 3.2% from June's 3.0% prediction, the Governing Council signalled an end to its most aggressive hiking cycle on record, given the anaemic economic growth in the euro zone.",

      description: "LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - There is no evidence so far that Britain's banks have been closing accounts because of people's political views, though more detailed scrutiny is needed, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday.\n\nBritish finance minister Jeremy Hunt last month asked the FCA to urgently investigate terminations of bank accounts and suggested that lenders who have broken the law should be fined.\n\nThe practice, known as 'debanking' became a political issue after former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said his account at private bank Coutts, part of NatWest, had been closed due to his political views.\n\nAn internal bank document unearthed by Farage later showed the decision was partly taken over his views, alongside commercial considerations.",

      description: "MOSCOW, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A Russian court has frozen 80.7 million euros (86.2 million) in securities owned by Germany's VTB Europe, a former subsidiary of Russia's VTB Bank (VTBR.MM), which was taken over by the German government last year, VTB said on Tuesday.\nVTB said the decision had been taken due to a lawsuit in which it was seeking 112.6 million euros from VTB Europe.\n\nThe court in St Petersburg granted VTB's request for interim measures to be imposed and seized the securities, court filings dated Sept. 14 showed.\nIn April 2022, following the imposition of Western sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine, VTB in Europe was no longer allowed to take instructions from the parent bank and its assets were cut off.\n",
